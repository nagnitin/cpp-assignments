/*
How many of these can be a variable name?
01PWskills  ---> not a variable since it starts with a number

 _FLOAT ---> it is a variable because $ and _ can be used at the starting name of a variable

 int ---> not a variable because 'int' is a keyword 

 FLOAT ---> it is a variable, inspite of being a keyword since it's written in all caps it's considered to be as a variable

 You will succeed --> not a variable because , and " " are not a convention too form a variable
